# Group rolls for DND 5e
Module implements group ability and skill check rolls per Player's Handbook, page 175: *"If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds."* Modules also includes patches to implement the *Halfling Lucky* trait, and a house rule to use the average of 2d20 for normal skill and ability check rolls.  Both of these patches can be disabled in config.js.  All patches rely on the included **patchClass** utility function.
